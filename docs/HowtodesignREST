1. Description of the conceptual structure of resources (identify the resources, with their
hierarchical structure; use plural names for collections and singular names for resources that
are not collections; specify the HTTP methods allowed for each resource).

2.Mapping of the resources to URLs (for simplicity, use URLs that are relative to the base
URL of the service; for resources that belong to collections, use the notation {id}, where id
is the name of the field that identifies the resource in the collection)

3. Description of each possible operation. For each resource, and for each method allowed on
the resource, specify the allowed query string parameters and/or the allowed request body,
the possible status codes, and, for each possible status code, the response body. For each
allowed query string parameter, specify name and XML schema type of the value (either a
standard XML schema simple type or one defined by you in the NfvDeployer.xsd
schema document). For request body and response body, specify the XML element, which
must be defined at the global level in the NfvDeployer.xsd schema document. Schema
elements and types in this description must be referenced by name. In practice, the
NfvDeployer.xsd schema document must include a set of global named types and a set
of global elements. As far as possible, the definitions already developed in the schema for
Assignment 1 should be reused. For each possible operation, a short description should also
be added when not obvious.

The web service must be designed so as to be compliant with the REST principles and conventions,
robust, easy to be used by clients, and enabling efficient execution of all the operations for which it
has been designed. The documentation should be self-contained (it should include all that is
necessary for a user to know to be able to consume the service, apart from what can be deduced
from the service itself and from the HTTP standard).
