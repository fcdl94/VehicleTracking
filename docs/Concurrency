For the creation of vehicles the main problem are related to path computation. In fact, if two vehicles compute together the path, they may violate constraints on some node.
To prevent any issue on vehicles, all the operation on a vehicle object are synchronized (gets, update, updatePosition and delete). This means that also the path, that is related to one
and only one vehicle, is modified synchronized.

To prevent issue in read operations for VTService and for the Nodes, all the maps, lists and sets use synchronized implementations
